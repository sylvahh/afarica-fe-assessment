# ATAfrica Frontend Assessment - Client Codebase

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the ATAfrica Frontend Assessment Client Codebase. This ReactJS project is a demonstration of my skills as a front-end developer, tackling tasks aligned with the responsibilities of a Mid-level Front End Developer role at ATAfrica.

**Overview:**
The project involves building a landing page for a Nigerian RoboAdvisor, inspired by platforms like Wealthfront and Wealthsimple.

**Technology Stack:**
- ReactJS (with TypeScript): A robust and efficient frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Other Tools: Render for deployment, GitHub for version control.

**Project Structure:**
The codebase is organized to ensure modularity and scalability. Key directories include:
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/screen`: Individual sections of the landing page.


**Project Tasks:**
1. **Upload Data to MongoDB:**
   - Utilized Postgres instead of MongoDB for data storage.
   - Implemented a seamless data upload process.

2. **Create an API:**
   - Utilized Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.
   - Established an API to fetch resources stored in the database.

3. **Design and Build a Landing Page:**
   - Structured the codebase to accommodate additional features.
   - Implemented a dynamic risk profile section with optimized React hooks.

4. **Create a Concise Presentation:**
   - Composed detailed documentation for the entire codebase.
